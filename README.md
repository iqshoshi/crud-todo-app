# crud-todo-app
A simple yet functional To-Do List Web Application as part of my hands-on practice with PHP and MySQL. This project allowed me to explore basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a web environment.

**Key Features:**

**Task Addition:** Users can add new tasks with titles and descriptions.
**Task Display:** All tasks are displayed in a structured table, showing their status (Pending or Completed).
**Task Deletion:** Tasks can be deleted directly from the interface.
**Task Update:** Users can toggle the status of tasks between "Pending" and "Completed".
**Database Integration:** Utilized MySQL for persistent storage of tasks.
**Responsive Design:** Basic styling for a user-friendly interface.

Technical Highlights:

Backend: Implemented in PHP with SQL queries for database interactions.
Database: MySQL, ensuring data persistence and integrity.
Frontend: Basic HTML forms and CSS for user interaction.
